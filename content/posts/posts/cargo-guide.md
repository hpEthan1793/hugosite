```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve(int a){

    }
int main(){
        return 0;
    }
```

```java
public class myclass(){
        public static void main(String[] args){
                System.out.println("Hello world");
            }
    }
```

You may be wondering what the above is... well it's actually a combination of both C++ and Rust. Infact it is not like that at all. I'm just typing random shit out so that I can test out this new Hugo SSG framework. I might consider re-uploading my website and do content/blogs or whatever so that I can look like a prisitne and superior intellectual! And yes I am using a pre-programmed theme because I'm too lazy to write my own one. Maybe in the future when I have time I will redo it.
