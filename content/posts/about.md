Hey there, I'm Ethan, and welcome to hpEthan1793. I’m a student from South Africa. Some people may describe me as a nerd, but what can I say, all genius comes at a cost. Some of my interests include, chess, programming and overachieving(not really) at school. I suppose, looking back at the things I’ve just mentioned I can see why people would consider me a nerd but what can I say. It is what it is. I started playing chess in grade four and I suppose you can say it’s grown on me. Programming and Web-Developemnt are more recent interests of mine but are still very enjoyable. Besides this I guess you could say I'm just a normal kid, but oh well... who cares anyways. So that's about all I can really say bout myself. Go check out my blog (I rarely post).

## Interests

I like chess. Started playing it when I was 10 and have been fond of it ever since. If you want to challenge me, I play on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org) as hpEthan1793.

I enjoy speedcubing, a sport involving solving a variety of combination puzzles, the most famous being the 3x3 puzzle or Rubik's Cube, as quickly as possible. For most puzzles, solving entails performing a series of moves that alters a scrambled puzzle into a state in which every face of the puzzle is a single, solid color. These specific moves are reffered to as algorithms.

Photos are also quite cool. I have some on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/hp_ethan1793). Maybe in the future I'll do like a gallery section on this blog. Maybe I'll start like doing professional photography and turn this into a photo portfolio. We'll see what happens ig.

If you got this far then thanks for reading.
